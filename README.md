A JavaScript game in which you must reveal and match each of the 10 pairs of buttons. Pairs of buttons share the same background color and number, letter, or symbol. There are some settings which you can use to customize your matching experience, such as a time limit, what to display on buttons, the key to start the game, and the audio volume for the sounds that will be added in the future. Settings are saved in localStorage.
